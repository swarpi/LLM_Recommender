      "Review: This a really cute kit which would make for a great gift for someone. It is in a little leather like pouch and has everything you need to give yourself a quality manicure. The nail clipper is a perfect size and works just as well on a women or man's nails. The file is nice as well (although I still prefer to use emory boards on mine). I actually bought another one of these to give to my son as a stocking stuffer this last Christmas for him to use at college. Just a nice, quality made kit at a reasonable price.\n",

      "Review: To be honest, I rarely have used an overnight cream. Typically, my skin care routine is the same morning and night (wash, apply hyalauronic serum, and some kind of moistutrizer). I do apply this about 30 minutes before I actually go to sleep to allow it time to be absorbed (before putting my face on my pillow) as it is a thicker type of cream and needs time. My skin in the morning feels better than ever. Soft and supple, I definitely feel a difference after using this for over 2 weeks now. I highly recommend this cream for women and men.\n",

      "Review: I try to get Keratin treatments every 3 months, but honestly it has been getting costly. I found it difficult to use and almost impossible to get to saturate the back of my hair and straight iron it the way they do in the salon. Then I saw the ingredients after the first time and saw it contained formaldehyde and that was the last time I used the actual treatment. I wish they sold the S&C separate because I really did like it and I am always in the market for a good hair wash which won't strip my hair between treatments. I will resume my regular treatments at my salon.\n",
      "Product: OGANA CELL Peptide Concentrating Amazing Lotion 2.03 fl.oz. (60ml) - 650ppm Peptide Contained Mild Moisturizing Facial Lotion, Hypoallergenic Natural Ingredients for Sensitive Skin\n",
      "Review: This is a really nice moisturizing lotion. It goes on lightly and is readily absorbed into my skin. My skin feels amazingly softer and smoother and allows for a nice base for my makeup to be applied over. You only need a small pea sized amount to cover your entire face and neck. Highly recommend for all skin types, ages and for women as well as men.\n",

      "Product: SERUM By MERLOT - RESVERATROL - NATURAL ANTI-AGING - DAMAGE CORRECTOR - BOOST COLLAGEN - 1 FL OZ. - DARK CIRCLE CORRECTOR -\n",
      "Review: This serum is more the consistency of a lotion than serums that I have used in the past. It has a nice fruity smell. It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. The serum absorbs quickly and isn't tacky or sticky. I am in my early fifties and use an assortment of anti-aging products daily. I haven't seen any new miraculous results with this, but it does moisturize. As a regular user of such products, I really don't think I would see anything new from them, but rather a continuation of what I have already started to achieve.\n",
      "Product: 6 Pack Soft Headband BEoffer Coral Fleece Women Makeup Spa Head Bands Turban Fashion Bow Bowknot Hairlace Headwear Wash Face Hair Holder Elastic Top Knot Bandage Girl Baby Hair Accessories 6 Colors\n",
      "Review: I wear headbands like this in the evening when washing my face and following my skincare routine. These headbands are very soft. I found these to be a little small, but they do stretch enough to accommodate my large head. I have just had other headbands that were a little larger and didn't require being stretched to the max just to fit. I like the variety of colors and have shared these with my eighteen year old daughter. One thing that I do like is that the bow doesn't get off centered as easily as my old one. My old one has to be adjusted every time I put it on.\n",
      "Product: BE PLAIN Vitamin Ampoule 1.01 fl oz. - Korean Multi Vitamin Serum for Face with Vitamin B, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Hyaluronic Acid\n",
      "Review: This is a light weight serum. It has a runny, liquidy consistency that's non-greasy. It doesn't leave behind any stickiness or tackiness. There is no scent to it either. It absorbs really fast and immediately hydrates your skin. It leaves a smooth finish. It's non-irritating and doesn't annoy my sensitive skin.\n",
      "Product: 2-Pack Puretize 16.9 Oz Hand Sanitizing Gel w/Pump Tops - Extra Strength 70% Ethyl Alcohol - Moisturizing Formula with Aloe Vera, Vitamin E & Botanical Extracts - Quick Drying Formula\n",
      "Review: For a new (or at least new to me) brand of hand sanitizer, I am pleased with it. I like the pump dispenser which is easy to use. The bottles are a good size. While you can detect the smell of the alcohol, it's not too strong or overpowering like some can be. With so many new brands out there these day, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase again.\n",
      "Product: MainBasics Headband with Buttons for Face Masks (Gray)\n",
      "Review: I have had issues with some masks not staying over my ears. This is a good way to utilize those masks. The  headband is comfortable and light weight. It has some stretch to it. The buttons are a little loose, so I tightened them before I wore the headband out in public. I found that I had to pay attention to how I was putting it on my head so the buttons were even, otherwise my mask was crooked. It's definitely a helpful item.\n",
      "Product: Caudalie Favorites Set\n",
      "Review: It's difficult to find some targeted skincare products in travel sizes. I can usually find cleansers and moisturizers, but serums and eye creams are not so easy to track down. This travel set comes with a foaming cleanser, an eye cream, a serum, and a moisturizer as well as a beauty spritz. The sizes are typical for travel. The individual products seem to be fine. The scents were light and floral. I have sensitive eyes and skin and nothing bothered them. I do think the kit is a bit pricey, but that's not affecting my review.\n",
      "Product: MD Complete Bright & Healthy Vitamin C+ Vitalizing Face Serum| with Vitamin C, Vitamin E and Herbal Extracts | Potent Antioxidant Protection, Nourishes, Brightens and Evens Skin 0.5 fl oz\n",
      "Review: I am in my early fifties and my morning skincare routine calls for Vitamin C serum. This doesn't smell like most other Vitamin C serums that I have used. It has a neutral scent that doesn't linger. The serum consistency is thick, but runny. It's a bit oily and doesn't absorb quickly. My skin can be sensitive at times, but I didn't have any problems with this. Overall, I like it, but I don't love it.\n",
      "Product: PINROSE Perfumes Bold Soul - Eau de Parfum Petals (Fragrance Towelettes) - Vegan, Cruelty-free, and Hypoallergenic Scent with Essential Oils - Notes of Crushed Blackberry, Tuberose, Vanilla, Cinnamon and Patchouli\n",
      "Review: These Pinrose Gilded Fox petals are a fun way to try out a new scent! The box comes with 12 packets. Each packet has a fragrance infused towelette. They aren't too wet, but you are able to rub or wipe them on your pulse points or wherever and transfer the scent to your body. This one has a very interesting smell. At first I didn't detect the chocolate, so it's a bit subtle. The smell is a powdery sweetness with a hint of chocolate. I threw away the wipe in my office trash can and caught pleasant whiffs of it throughout the day.\n",
      "Product: invisibobble Sprunchie Spiral Hair Ring - True Black - Scrunchie Stylish Bracelet, Strong Elastic Grip Coil Accessories for Women - Gentle for Girls Teens and Thick Hair\n",
      "Review: This is my first scrunchie. I have not had my hair cut in about 9 months because of the pandemic, so my hair has gotten longer than I've worn it in years! I'm in my early 50's and it's a little below my shoulders now. My hair is thick and coarse. It's long enough to wear in a messy bun for the first time in years! The scrunchie is easy to use and holds up my thick hair pretty well. I don't have to readjust it because it's falling. You can feel the coils inside the fabric. I find it fascinating how it works.\n",
      "Product: GENSKIN Generation Skin Hydrating Marine Algae Eye Patches | Hydrate, Plump, Brighten Eye Area 180g/6.34 Oz - 30 pairs\n",
      "Review: I like wearing eye masks such as these. I store them in my small beauty refrigerator which makes them even more enjoyable. After wearing them, I felt ready to take on the world! It comes with a little spatula so you can take them out of the jar without touching them. It felt like they were slipping as I wore them, but when I went to the bathroom to remove them, they were still in place where I left them. One thing I like about this type of eye mask is that it's easy to go about your day while wearing them. I didn't have any issues with sensitivity thankfully. My eyes are super sensitive.\n",

      "Product: Foot Peel Mask For Cracked Heels, Dead Skin & Calluses - Make Your Feet Baby Soft & Get a Smooth Skin, Removes & Repairs Rough Heels\n",
      "Review: I have been wanting to try these food peels. I was nervous to try but after reading some of the other reviews I finally did and am glad I did. Followed directions and my feet started to peel the next day. No bad reactions or problems. I didn’t use the included tool. Soaking your feet each day helps with the peeling process.\n",
      "Product: Maya Mari Hydrating Argan Oil Shampoo – Rich in Nutrients, Restores Moisture & Shine, 32 oz\n",
      "Review: Decent shampoo. I used it alone without conditioner so I could see how it worked and it seemed to clean my hair well and leave it manageable. The scent is ok as well. While I didn’t notice anything negative there wasn’t anything that stood out to me to buy it again.\n",
      "Product: 2 Pack Hair Towel Wrap Turban Microfiber Drying Shower and Bath, Twist Head Towels with Button, Magic Quick Dryer, Hair Care for Women and Girls, One Wrap Plus One Cap and Two Velvet Hair Bands\n",
      "Review: Great set of hair items. Would make a nice gift. Works as described. The material is extremely plush and soft and feels luxurious to wear.\n",
      "Product: Organic Sweet Almond Oil and Fractionated Coconut Oil Bundle for Hair and Skin, 100% Pure and Natural, Hexane-Free, Moisturizing, For Healthy Skin, Silky Hair, Multiuse Body Oil, 16 fl. Oz X 2\n",
      "Review: Great set of oils that are great to use as is or when making other products. I used the coconut oil in a roller ball with some tea tree and clove oil for a rash and it works great. They are both have no scent.\n",
      "Product: LeiCare Tweezers Precision 2-Pack - Stainless Steel Slant Tweezers for Ingrown Hair – Professional Tweezer Set with Slanted Tips for Eyebrows and Splinter Removal - Eyebrow Plucker Kit\n",
      "Review: These look like nice tweezers, similar in look to tweezerman tweezers but for some reason they don’t grip hairs very well and are very annoying for me. They seem to match up perfectly at the end so not sure why they don’t grab well. Will use as backups or keep in purse or car.\n",
      "Product: 3 Barrel Curling Iron, Milantia 3/4 Inch Mini Travel Curling Wand Hair for Small Curly, Dual Voltage Ceramic Tourmaline 19mm Crimper Hair Iron for Women - Fast Heating, Portable\n",
      "Review: Tiny waver that works great to make smaller sized waves. Heats quickly and makes waves quickly. Only took a few minutes to do all of my daughters hair. I only do a top layer of hair and around the face. Find that it looks less poofy this way. Seems well made and good quality.\n",
      "Product: 5-Pack Hair Scalp scrubber Massager Shampoo Brush for Straight Curly Long Short Thick Thin Wet Dry Hair, Men Women Kids Scalp Care Hair Cleaning Shower, Scalp Care Brush,100% comfortable\n",
      "Review: These are so popular and I was excited to try but I don’t feel like it did it for me. It was hard to get down to my scalp and move around. Felt much easier to just use my fingers. Maybe I need to practice more of try a different massager. They seem well made though and look just like the picture.\n",
      "Product: Heyedrate Activated Charcoal Soap Bar and Face Wash | Organic, Vegan, Natural Soap made with Dead Sea Mud and Our Essential Oil Blend (1 Pack (5 Ounces))\n",
      "Review: Great quality soap! So many good ingredients that are good for skin and hydrating not drying. Smells great and skin feels clean and soft after. Highly recommend.\n",
      "Product: Calendula Soap With Coconut Oil Soap - Natural Body Soap | Best Body Bar For Dry & Sensitive Skin | Use As A Bath Soap & Face Pure Extracts (2.64 Ounce)\n",
      "Review: Great soap with mild natural scent. Works great on my sensitive skin. Leaves it soft and clean and doesn’t dry it out.\n",
      "Product: Got2b Glued Spray Wax with 2-in-1 Dual Nozzle, 8 oz\n",
      "Review: This is much faster and less messy than using the cream. Quick any easy. Not the longest hold but good for a few hours. Not much of any smell to it which is probably better. Some of these wax's are way too fragrant.\n",

      "Product: Nxconsu 12Pcs Headbands for Women Girls Teens Elastic Hair Bands Silky Solid Colors Pleated Crinkle Head Band Fashion Trendy Outfit Colorful Thin Comfortable Hair Accessories for Home Work Gym Casual\n",
      "Review: There are 12 headbands in this set and practically all of them look a similar shade of pastel pink, purple, and yellow. Only one headband is bold with an emerald green. I would have liked a red, black, and brown in this set. However, this appears to be designed for young girls or ballerinas who would love these colors.<br /><br />I tried these on and the headbands are comfortable and do not squeeze my head. I have a small head so these would probably feed a youngster just fine.<br /><br />The current price of $15.99 comes to a reasonable $1.33 per headband.\n",
      "Product: Reusable Shower Cap for Women – Leakproof, Nonslip Hair Cap for Shower w/ Comfy Flexiband – Soft, Breathable Shower Caps for Women Reusable Waterproof – Durable, Heavy Duty Shower Cap by SMPL OBJECTS (Marble)\n",
      "Review: I love this shower cap. It is very attractive and the black and white colors just pop. I have short to medium-length fine curly hair and take a size small in a cap. This fits me perfectly and there is a little more room for more hair if I had it. This is comfortable and does keep my hair dry in the shower. Unfortunately, I hate the way the bow looks on me.<br /><br />The current price of $15.99 is on the high side of competitively priced.\n",
      "Product: STARAMZ 7 Set Bachelorette Scrunchies Bridesmaid Proposal Gifts Hair Ties for Women Bachelorette Party Favors ( Blush)\n",
      "Review: There are six blush-colored scrunchies and one white scrunchie. The material is a bit slick so there is a chance these will slip out of the hair. I have medium length hair in the back and they did slip out easily if I pulled on them. I do feel these are elegant and super attractive. If the bride and bridesmaids all have long hair, then these are a good option. I have no idea what these will be priced at but anything more than $10.50 (which would be 1.50 each) is too much.\n",
      "Product: Spanature Aloe Vera Hand & Body Lotion Travel Size Selection, 4 Pack, Relaxing and Revitalizing Moisturizer for Rough and Dry Skin, Nourishing and Gentle for All Skin Types, Made In Korea - 75 ml/2.53oz\n",
      "Review: There are four individually packaged 2.53 fluid ounce tubes of moisturizer in this set. They are all the same tubes. This moisturizer is lightweight and is mildly hydrating. It absorbs quickly and is a good product to use in the summer. I also like the fresh cucumber-like aroma. I did, however, expect this to be more hydrating than it is. It is a decent cream but not excellent.<br /><br />The current price of $15.00 comes to a reasonably priced $3.75 per tube.\n",
      "Product: Tirtyl Hand Soap Sheet Variety Pack - 240 Pack with Portable Storage Tin - Camping/Outdoor/Travel/Handbag - Lavender & Aloe - Bergamot & Ylang Ylang - Jasmine & Patchouli\n",
      "Review: There are three packages of wafer thin sheets of soap in 80 sheets each pack. Also, even though there are three wonderful fragrances (lavender & aloe, bergamot & ylang ylang, and jasmine & patchouli) that smell great as a whole 80 sheets, that fragrance does not come through on the hands because the soap is too thin to leave any fragrance behind.<br /><br />The current price of $13.95 comes to $.06 cents per sheet. I consider these perfect for when using a public restroom that has water but no soap.\n",
      "Product: Fragrantshare Makeup Brushes Professional Organizer Foundation Brush for Liquid makeup Travel 9Pcs Sets - Odorless Fiber Hair - Light Blue\n",
      "Review: This is a gorgeous set that contains a brush for most uses. There is no fan, eyebrow, or lip brush, however.<br /><br />Each brush comes individually packaged. Their soft bristles feel good against my skin and work like many other brushes I tried previously. I do wish the handles were a tad longer. Nevertheless, the current price of $8.99 is an super reasonable for this set as it comes to $1 per brush.<br /><br />This is a perfect set for the young teenager starting out on her make-up journey.\n",
      "Product: Florona Hibiscus Air Freshener Room Spray for Deep Sleep 100 ml - Pure & Unrefined Pillow Mist & Linen Spray (Hibiscus,100 ml)\n",
      "Review: This is a nice room freshener. The fragrance is subtle but lovely and floral. Some fragrances give me a headache if they are too strong but this one does not. I love spraying this in my bedroom. It is also a great fragrance to relax with before falling asleep--no dangerous scented candle needed. It does not help promote sleep for me but it is soothing to my senses. The aroma does not last long--about 15 minutes. I happen to like fragrance, so I do like this linen spray.\n",
      "Product: Bath Bombs Gift Set, Bath Bomb Gift for Women with Rose Petals, Lavender Scent 5pc Handmade Bubble Bath Gift Box with Soap & Petals Mothers Day Gifts Ideas for Mom, New Mom, Wife Birthday Gift for Her\n",
      "Review: [[VIDEOID:f77804a8088c40dfbef6fdcfacf8b15a]] There are three individually wrapped bath bombs in this set along with one bar of hand soap and a package of dried rose petals. In total there are five items. The bath bombs spell MOM with the heart substituting for the letter O.<br /><br />The outside packaging looks giftable but the inside is just an ordinary uninspiring throw-away box. The fragrance of the bombs and soap is hardly noticeable. I did try the letter M bomb in a hand bath and it dissolved in 5 minutes in lukewarm water and a nice foam of suds lasted about 10 minutes.\n",
      "Product: Beautiful Girl You Can Do Amazing Things, Inspirational Gifts for Women, Christmas Gifts, Amazing Gifts for Teen Girls, Beautiful Gift Makeup Bag, Inspirational Jewelry Dish, Amazing Mirror\n",
      "Review: It contains a beautiful compact mirror with regular and close-up mirrors on the inside. Both mirrors are small but functional. It is fashioned like a pocket watch. The clasp is solid and the finish is high-gloss like the interior mirror itself.<br /><br />The saying (see below) on the outside of both sides of the mirror is inspirational. It says \"Beautiful girl you can do amazing things. \"<br /><br />There is also a small dish for jewelry and a very cheap make-up case all with the same inspirational verse.<br /><br />In summary, this is a nice gift set.\n",
      "Product: ForPro Expert Therapy Massage Lotion, Fragrance-Free, Relax Sore Muscles & Repair Dry Skin, Lightweight, Non-Greasy Formula, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 1 Gallon (128 Ounces)\n",
      "Review: This comes in a one gallon jug. First, the biggest negative is that it takes work to dispense the lotion. Second, this lightweight lotion goes on tacky and takes a few minutes to absorb. My favorite lotion is [[ASIN:B09HYPWMKG Ginger Lily Farms Pure Morocco Argan Oil Butter Lotion]]. That is perfect for a massage as well. It has a fragrance and is cruelty-free but not vegan.<br /><br />This is decent but the initial tackiness I dislike. The current price of $54.99 for 128 ounces comes to $.43 per ounce, which is almost double the price of the lotion I love.\n",

      "Review: I'm trying to do a better job with paying as much attention to the ingredients in my skincare as those in my food. This is a great natural cleanser. It's very gentle and is good for sensitive skin. The lactic acid hydrates and gently exfoliates over time. You won't need a science degree to understand the majority of the ingredients. This is a great clean beauty cleanser that I highly recommend.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.\n",

      "Review: If you're reading this review, you probably already know the anti-aging benefits of collagen. This mask has a high-potency form of collagen along with a special delivery system to help firm your skin. The mask is in two parts, so you can get a better fit than a regular sheet mask. I can't say it performs miracles, but it's definitely worth a try.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.\n",

      "Review: Every mascara claims to be new and different. This one actually lives up to the hype. The fibers have a novel shape that really makes your lashes POP. If you're not a fan of falsies, this is a great alternative. The formula isn't waterproof, so keep that in mind. I HIGHLY recommend this product.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.\n",

      "Review: I really like this moisturizer. It's lightweight and creamy. It has a light cucumber scent that I find refreshing. It's a powerhouse at deeply hydrating parched skin. It also locks in moisture to keep skin looking fresh. It contains botanicals that soothe irritated or inflamed skin. It's ideal for those with acne, rosacea or eczema. You can use it as both a day and night cream. I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.

      "Review: I really like that this mask includes special patches for the eyes and smile lines. If you're over 30, you'll appreciate the extra help. You apply the patches first, the the sheet mask. I keep all of my sheet masks in the refrigerator. You'll appreciate the cooling and anti-inflammatory effect if you do so with this mask.

It's a great hydration and brightening mask. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.

      "Review: One of the reasons skin starts to wrinkle as we age is that we make less and less of the natural oil that keeps skin looking youthful. This serum is a good way to supplement what your skin lacks. The oils in this blend are all high quality. The texture is lightweight and easily absorbed. Dr. Denese is a trusted brand when it comes to care for aging skin. Whether you're trying to slow the clock or reverse it a little, this serum should be part of your daily skincare routine.

      "Product: Moisturizing Facial Emulsion for Restoring Hydrating Smoothing Skin from Manilla Natural Skincare\n",
      "Review: With winter approaching, it's time to start thinking about cold-weather skincare. This moisturizer is a good choice because it's a blend of several skin-loving oils like argan, coconut and macadamia. It's fairly lightweight but it protects and hydrates like a heavier cream. It can be used both day and night. The packaging is pretty enough for display. It can be used by all skin types. I highly recommend this product and the entire line from this brand.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.

      "Review: I'm a true skincare addict. I really like these holiday sets. They're a good way to try new products. Caudalie is a cult favorite for a reason. Their products are made from the grapes in their vineyards. You get all the benefits of the resveratrol in pretty packaging. This set comes with a moisturizer, serum and foaming cleanser. This set is a great value. It makes the perfect gift. As a note, my box was a bit banged up. The products weren't properly glued to the base, so they came out in the shipping package.

      "Review: I ordered LA LA Leaf Guayaquil hemp lotion for my husband . He's always rubbing creams and lotions into his elbows with very little positive results. SINGLE. lol. Let me tell you, the hemp oil, rose flower water white bark extract , aloe (a fave of mine) ingredients do a heck of a job softening and smoothing my hands after I apply LA LA Leaf. I'm already planning on using extra LA LA Leaf in the winter when my hands get the dreaded deep, extremely painful cracks due to cold weather. I do believe LA LA Leaf is worth the cost. I have every intention of continuing to use/buy LA LA Leaf.\n",
      "Product: Gentlehomme Face Moisturizer For Men - Mens Facial Lotion with Neroli Essential Oil Scent - Collagen & Stem Cells - Daily Anti-Aging Moisturizer for Dry & Oily Skin - 4 oz\n",
      "Review: My husband has dry skin that is worsening now that cold weather has arrived and the heat is on in the house on pretty much a regular basis. I ordered this cream to help moisturize his dry skin as well as  reduce his fine lines as he approaches the 'big 5-0'. He's not yet noticed a reduction to his fine lines though he hasn't been using the lotion very long but he is pleased with the job its doing to help moisturize his skin. He is a fan of the scent and he's happy that the lotion doesn't cause his skin to look or feel oily/greasy.\n",
      "Product: FRESHME Mud Mask - Facial Mask Kaolinite Clay Masks Cleansing and Moisturizing Brightening Smoothing Face Mask, 3.4 fl oz\n",
      "Review: The directions on the tube of FRESHME's mud mask (pelargonium graveolens) state  those with sensitive skin should use the mud mask once a week. I also followed the directions that state the mask should be used after bathing or after warming the skin with a towel for 5 minutes. Perhaps my skin is just too sensitive because I really didn't notice much of a  difference after using this mud mask. I cannot detect any change to my pores. This just isn't the mud mask for me. I've discontinued using it and will be giving the rest to my niece over the holidays.\n",
      "Product: Organic Sweet Almond Oil and Fractionated Coconut Oil Bundle for Hair and Skin, 100% Pure and Natural, Hexane-Free, Moisturizing, For Healthy Skin, Silky Hair, Multiuse Body Oil, 16 fl. Oz X 2\n",
      "Review: I am finding SO many uses for Shiny Leaf's coconut and sweet almond oil! I do have some experience with coconut oil but this is my first time using sweet almond oil. Both oils also work wonders on hair by moisturizing, hydrating, improving hair texture/strength, stimulate hair growth /thicken hair, and nourish the scalp to prevent dry, itchy flakes. I didn't whip through numerous tissues like normal.\n",
      "Product: EASYDEW Starter Moist Whip Foam 5.07 fl oz - Non-Drying, Gentle & Purifying Foaming Cleanser with Ceramide I Exfoliating Daily Face Wash that Removes Dirts and Makeup\n",
      "Review: Should I start my review by telling you how incredibly creamy Easydew Daily face wash is? In fact, prior to seeing this face wash in my VINE offers, I'd never even heard of Easydew brand products. After I rinse with lukewarm water and pat my skin dry with a towel, my skin is soft, smooth, clean and has  a bit of a glow. It looks and feels so good and healthy. Everything about this daily wash is perfect in my book. Easydew is officially  a part of my daily skin care  routine now.\n",
      "Product: Huxley Secret of Sahara Clay Mask Balanced Blend 4.23 fl. oz. | Korean Clay Mask to Refine Pores and Absorb Excess Oil and Sebum | Made with Moroccan Rhassoul Clay\n",
      "Review: Thanks to dry, sensitive skin, I'm always a bit concerned when trying new skin care products. It makes me SO happy to report that I do not experience any negative issues with HUXLEY Secret of the Sahara Clay mask. But don't let that fool you, it may be gentle but it does a heck of an exceptional job! It exfoliates well leaving my skin soft, smooth , a bit brighter and healthy. Dead skin cells are washed away. My skin literally feels GOOD after using Huxley. It is recommended Huxley be used 1-3 times a week. I absolutely recommend Huxley.\n",
      "Product: GAINWELL\n",
      "Review: I'm so amazed by boar bristle hairbrushes and how incredible they make hair look and feel. This GAINWELL boar bristle brush is a wonderful, compact brush. It may be small but it works wonders on our family's hair. It works through tangles without pulling or causing pain while leaving hair soft, shiny and manageable. The compact size makes it perfect for travel, to keep in a purse, a school/gym locker, briefcase or even a pocket. If you've never experienced a boar bristle brush, I HIGHLY recommend giving it a try. I can't imagine they receive a ton of calls with issues but its great to know customer service is a  priority!\n",
      "Product: John Frieda Detox and Repair Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Nourishing Avocado Oil and Green Tea, 8.45 Fl Oz (Pack of 2)\n",
      "Review: John Frieda's Detox shampoo/conditioner duo is an excellent way to revive and restore hair. The shampoo does a brilliant job of not only cleansing hair, it cleanses the scalp and washes away buildup leaving hair soft and shiny. The conditioner detangles, hydrates and adds bounce to even the driest hair.<br /><br />Both have a nice scent though it doesn't last long, at least not in my hair! Each is easy to work into hair and rinse out as well. I like to use this duo once a week. I experience no color fading or allergic reactions as I have sensitive skin. Definitely worth the price and absolutely recommended!\n",
      "Product: HASK CUCUMBER + ALOE Body Wash 2 Pack- Refreshing, vegan formula, hypoallergenic, dermatologist tested, pH balanced- 2 Pack of 24.5 oz Bottles\n",
      "Review: I LOVE Hask hair products. So, I was super excited test Hask's body wash. But I had a problem right from the start. I had to decide between 4 fantastic choices! Coconut, Lavender + Vanilla, Cucumber + Aloe and Shea + Cocoa Butter. The scent is delicious- light , crisp and not at all overwhelming. When I step out of the bathtub my skin feels wonderful and I feel nice and relaxed.\n",
      "Product: SUPRENT Razors for Men with Matrix Cutter Head, 38.5° Golden Angle Shaving Kit for Men, Travelling Razor Kit-1 Mens Razor Handle, 2 Blade Refills,1 Dock,1 Shave Foam\n",
      "Review: Gives me a close shave with no tugging. Better than an electric razor\".<br /><br />That's the first thing my husband had to say after he tested SUPRENT's  Matrix Cutter Head travel kit razor for the first time. A razor handle, 2-blade refills (each with the first of its kind 6 ultra-thin blades total! ), a dock to hold the razor and a bottle of shaving foam are included.<br /><br />The handle is sleek and heavy but easy and comfortable to hold. The presentation is gorgeous and the product works exceptionally well. Without a doubt this is worthy of gift giving.\n",

      "Product: Pippa Of London Magic Star Eyeshadow Powder Pencil, Long Lasting, Blendable Eye Make Up Stick\n",
      "Review: I like to keep my make up simple, so I often go for an eye shadow pencil; something I can swipe on in a single color and be done. I often go for very light colors, or even more into brown or purple. This \"chalfont 303- a shimmering shade of pearl\" reminds more of a yellow tinged shimmery champagne rather than what I think of as pearl (white leaning pink). It is definitely not a white pink, too bad. I may use it blended in with something, but it otherwise looks sallow on my fair, pink skin with blue undertones.\n",

      "Review: Easydew is skin care that is functional, effective, and always seems to live up to the expectations. I happen to like EGF (epidemal growth factors), and if you don't then just don't purchase Easydew DW-EGF products. I recommend doing a quick search to learn more about \"EGF in skin care\". I use other Easydew products with success.<br /><br />My 40 something dry skin benefits from the gentle, hydrating cleansing. It has some creamy lather, kinda foamy, feels nice to massage in, and rinses clean. Skin feels good. Mornings I use just water based cleansers.\n",

      "Review: I'm pleasantly surprised by this Almay Length & Lift mascara. As for lengthening, lifting, volumizing, etc is meaningless in comparison. YAY!!! Also, the blackest black is wonderfully black; makes my brown eyes pop. Length is notable too. I dont care for make up except for mascara, but I rarely find one worthwhile. I keep looking in the mirror at my new found eye lashes!! haha! !<br /><br />this product is hypoallergenic and ophthalmologist tested.<br /><br />PS. Pics are of mascara only.\n",

Overall healthy save for redness & visible veins from Type 1 Rosacea (no bumps, no acne, just redness).<br /><br />Reminds me of some of the thick, luscious, rich leave on night \"masks\" that I use.

      "Review: Nice feeling moisture boost. Lightweight, nothing oily about it to me. My dry skin loves a good hydrating toner, and this fits that need. I pat some on all over face, neck and chest. Sometimes I do this a few times to saturate my skin. Then I follow up with other products (serum, moisturizer, and/or sunscreen). Ceramides help build and maintain a healthy skin barrier. Hyaluronic acid attracts moisture (but be sure to lock it in with a moisturizer or an occlusive ingredient). Sedum provides intense hydration & minerals, and vitamins to the skin. So lots of good stuff going on with this toner.\n",

But I am definitely pushing max space available (again, I have a large head).<br /><br />I simply dont wash my hair every day, but I do hop in the shower. The rear has an elastic portion to provide a nice fit. The spacing left over once in place is reasonable for my large head and mane of hair. I have some cute shower caps, but none as nice as this.\n",

      "Review: There's not a lot of salt in here to make it exfoliate very well. That said, it moisturizes and hydrates beautifully. Everything dissolves and washes off completely and it smells so light and fresh!\n",
      "Product: lilah b. - Bronzed Beauty Bronzer Duo - b. sunkissed - Multipurpose Bronzer Duo to Highlight + Contour and Blend\n",
      "Review: This is such a high end product. The weighted compact feels sleek and heavy in your hand. The slide/pivot opening is clever and works smooth. The color saturation is rich and deep and looks flawless on many skin tones. Not too much shimmer, so it actually looks like you've been sun kissed after application. Buildable color if you want a more intense look. You can use both colors together, which is what I do. I am medium complexion, blonde, 48 years old. This product doesn't increase pores size, nor does it settle into any wrinkles. In my opinion, deserving of more than 5 stars.\n",
      "Product: CESTLV Bamboo Charcoal Toothbrush + Toothpaste Kit (10 Pack Bulk), Hotel Amenities for Guest & Travel, BPA Free, Individually Boxed Dental Kits, Recyclable\n",
      "Review: Very decent bamboo toothbrush. Generally the bristles are too soft for me. This one is medium-soft. So at least it feels like my mouth is clean after brushing. Lightweight, no guilt. Even the packaging is made from recycled material. Great to have multi pack!\n",
      "Product: Purple Hair Mask for Blonde with Keratin & Jojoba Oil - Platinum & Silver Hair - Instantly Eliminate Brassiness & Yellows - Made in USA - Hair Toner - Bleached & Highlighted Hair - Sulfate Free - 8 oz\n",
      "Review: This masks works great! My hair is blonde and fine and tends to go brassy if not processed correctly. Using this mask is an easy way to freshen and brighten. Not too thick, almost whipped in texture. Totally moisturizes and rinses out without heavy residue.\n",
      "Product: JDO Eyelash Curler and 4D Silk Fiber Lash Mascara Value Set-Lash Curler with Refill Pads for No Pinching or Pulling, Mascara Natural Thickening- Long Lasting Waterproof & Smudge-Proof\n",
      "Review: My 14 yo is using this set and she loves it. The mascara is a deep black and it doesn't flake off. She also has had no problems removing this product with just a wet makeup wipe. The curler has rubber grips at the end so it is easy for her to hold and use. Very happy with this.\n",
      "Product: Laloirelle Luminous Face Oil - Organic Pomegranate Oil, Cacao Oil Infused W/Brightening White Peony Root, Marigold Flower, Lotus Leaf - Glowing Skin That Feels Hydrated, Plump and Firm - 1.0 fl oz\n",
      "Review: This serum is so very very good! Smells warm and woodsy in a way, not floral or soapy. Very viscous, medium-heavy. The dropper only dispenses about 4 drops, which is enough for face and neck. I use a roller after applying too, which I highly recommend. I'm happy with the glow and hydration my skin has. The longer I use it, the better my skin looks.\n",

It smells similar to rubbing alcohol, however it’s not too strong. I love this hand sanitizer as it doesn’t dry out my hands like others. Every family needs a bottle of this in their home!\n",

      "Review: My wife really likes this perfume by Shakira! It has a nice sweet scent, with a hint of spice. It’s an incredibly sexy scent that I love too! ❤️ It doesn’t last the whole day, however if you reapply in the afternoon, it does. The bottle is beautiful too!

      "Review: These bath bombs are great, especially for the price. You get 18 bath bombs in the box.

Each bath bomb is wrapped in tissue paper and labeled. The packaging is just amazing!<br /><br />The scents are strong, so these may not work for you if you are sensitive to strong scents. I personally think they smell wonderful!\n",
      "Product: Spanature Green Tea Hand & Body Lotion Travel Size Selection, 4 Pack, Revitalizing Moisturizer for Rough and Dry Skin, Nourishing and Gentle for All Skin Types, Made In Korea - 75 ml/2.53oz\n",
      "Review: This 4 pack of travel lotions by Spanature is super nice, from the presentation of the product, to the performance of the product. They come packaged soooo nicely in 4 little gift boxes, so they are perfect for gift giving. Also, the tubes are the perfect size to fit in your purse- so they are great for on the go or even traveling!<br /><br />The lotion itself is very moisturizing, and not greasy at all. The green tea scent is not strong at all, which is perfect if you are sensitive to strong scents.\n",

      "Review: This is a nice cream by Simply Dana. It comes in a simple yet elegant glass jar. The cream itself has a pleasant but mild fragrance. The cream itself is very creamy and lightweight. It absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving behind any residue.<br /><br />The skin feels soft and smooth when you use this cream. I for one like how my skin feels when I use this. It looks nice and just feels moisturized. All in all for a lower priced cream this is not a bad choice.\n",

      "Review: This is a pretty nice shampoo. You get a massive bottle of this shampoo that comes in a convenient bottle with a pump dispenser on the top, which personally I prefer since it makes it so much easier to use in the shower especially. The shampoo itself smells very nice, which is a big plus in my eyes.<br /><br />It lathers up very nice and cleanses your with ease. Once you are done the shampoo rinses out quite quickly without any issues. The hair feels nice and clean and I for one am quite happy. This is a pretty good deal and I for one am happy with this.\n",

      "Review: In this jar you get 30 pairs of marine algae eye patches. The jar is quite pretty and will look good in any bathroom. The eye patches smell great and are rather soothing to be honest. However I have to say paying $24, much cheaper than their green tea version.<br /><br />These work quite nicely and I do really like them. I do like how soothing these are and use them when my under eye area is puffy or is very dark and seems like I have been put through the ringer.\n",

It has a low molecular hyaluronic acid which helps adding moisture to the skin and is meant for daily treatment of your face.<br /><br />It has a mild fragrance only and is nice and fresh. Pour some of it on a cotton pad and gently pad the essence onto your skin until it is fully absorbed.<br /><br />I find it absorbs quickly into the skin. This is a lovely product.\n",

      "Review: This sugar body scrub is amazing. It has an amazing fragrance which is what you will notice first when you open the jar. The scrub is a gentle exfoliator and works very well. It moisturizes as you go along and makes your skin feel soft and smooth. It does have oil in it so that is what makes your skin feel moisturized and you may feel greasy, my recommendation, don't use a ton of it when you use it and start with just a little bit which goes a long way.\n",

      "Review: I wasn't expecting my mirror to get a cleaning also! I was excited to finally have a water pick so when I received my package I immediately set it up and studied the directions. Once I was confident, I began and as soon as i turn it on, water went everywhere! It all ricochet ed all oclver my bathroom counter and mirror. Safe to say that you literally need to use this in the shower. But besides that, it has many attachments, different speeds and does a great job!\n",
      "Product: Taya Beauty Inner Core Hair Strong Anti-Breakage Shampoo & Conditioner Duo - Strengthening and Repairing Formula - Free From Sulfates and Parabens - 8 fl oz Bottles\n",
      "Review: I love the combination of this shampoo and conditioner. Both smell like sweet coconut.<br />The shampoo has a thick and luxurious lather and definitely feels like it adds volume to my hair.<br />The conditioner is thick, but light, a bit like a body butter. It softens my hair and leaves it extremely soft and silky.<br />The only reason I can't give these products five stars is because I think they're a bit overpriced. Yes, they create great results, but so do a lot of comparable brands that are less than half the price.\n",
      "Product: Beast Blue Ultra Cooling Body Wash, 6 oz -Beast\n",
      "Review: This is definitely a \"cooling\" body wash. It makes my skin tingle and would be excellent in the summer months when you need to bring your body temperature down. The scent is like menthol-eucalyptus, but a bit sweeter. The lather is very thick and smooth, and it rinses away leaving my skin feeling cool and moisturized. The only reason for the 4-star rating is the price. $15 is a bit much for 6 ounces of product.\n",
      "Product: Gents of London Design Paste Matt Firm Hold Professional Hair Styling Wax (3 oz)\n",
      "Review: This is a great product. The hold is strong, the finish is truly matte, and the price is a lot better than comparable clays, waxes and fibers. It has a light, masculine scent.\n",
      "Product: No Brainer Gentle Facial Cleanser, 6 fl. oz, For Dry & Sensitive Skin, Leaves Skin Feeling Clean, Soft and Hydrated, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein & Amino Acids Restores Skin by Higher Education Skincare\n",
      "Review: Aside from being a tad overpriced for a daily face wash, this stuff is great. It smells like cucumber - clean and fresh, it has the consistency of aloe vera gel but a bit thicker. The lather is low-foam. It feels great on my skin, and leaves it feeling soft and moisturized. Definitely a high quality product.\n",

      "Review: I really like this moisturizer. The consistency is extremely soft and smooth, and it feels incredible on my skin. It moisturizes wonderfully and feels like it actually fortifies the skin, making it feel thicker and stronger. The scent is very fresh and it absorbs well. I am already noticing (after a few days) a slight lightening of the skin under my eyes, which is exciting. A bit pricey, but definitely high quality.\n",

PLEASE try out this mascara. My lashes looked significantly longer and thicker with out any flakes or clumps. A very long lasting mascara  for a relatively decent price. Also, considering how long lasting it wore, the removal was insanely easy. I love this mascara!\n",

      "Review: I end up using my normal face wash afterwards to feel properly cleansed.<br /><br />To be fair I don't wear much face makeup so perhaps this might work better for someone that wears foundation. Seems like more work than is necessary and kinda makes me feel like it will clog my pores in the long run...\n",
      "Product: Hair Scrunchies for women,Including 3 Pcs Long Silk Satin Hair Scarf & 3 Pcs Bunny Ear Scrunchies & 3 Pcs Elastic Hair Bands Scrunchy and 7Pcs Pearl Hair Clips,(16Pcs/9Colors)\n",
      "Review: These scrunchies look great in person, especially the plain scrunchies, theyre a beautiful silk like material that has some shine to it. The plain ones also have a heavy duty elastic in them. I have super thick long hair and these do a great job of keeping my hair in a bun.<br /><br />Ive definitely overpaid for scrunchies at urban outfitters when these are just as nice if not nicer for sooo much cheaper. They're great! :)<br /><br />The little barettes are just okay, I find they pull my hair but the scrunchies are totally worth it.\n",
      "Product: Bioré J-Beauty Makeup Removing Moisturizing Cleansing Jelly, Top Japanese Makeup Remover, Gentle Skin Cleanser, Mild Floral Fragrance, Non-Greasy, 7.8 Ounce\n",
      "Review: Was interested in what this was going to feel like but I guess \"jelly\" really is the closest consistency to describe this.<br /><br />It more viscous than water and has a bit of \"bounce\" to it but doesn't feel oily or greasy. Then rinse k<br /><br />I have combo skin with drier cheeks and this doesn't leave my skin feeling stripped or dry.\n",
      "Product: Queendom Unlashed Mascara | Volumizing and Lengthening | Boosts Lash Length | Vegan, Cruelty Free, Paraben Free\n",
      "Review: It has longer and shorter hard bristles along the sides. I'm by no means a beginner with mascara, but for some reason I've poked my eye with this mascara applicator a couple of times already.\n",
      "Product: Color Me Cosmetics Gel Manicure Kit with LED Lamp - DIY Gel Nail Starter Set with Prep, Base and Top Coat, 2 Gel Polish Colors & Nail Tools - Beginner Nail Kit with Everything You Need Made in USA*\n",
      "Review: The polishes in this set work wonderfully and the packaging is very nice and would make an excellent gift! Unfortunately I bumped the lamp off my table and it fell about 3 feet and stopped working...I didn't think it was much of a fall so I was pretty surprised it didn't turn on anymore.<br /><br />The lamp was compact and easy to use, fit one hand at a time. Fortunately I have another lamp but pretty bummed this one broke so easily. :/\n",

      "Review: I've tried the regular ones and love those. These don't stretch quite as well and feel a bit tighter when I wrap it around. I think they're alright but I prefer the normal ones much more.\n",

      "Review: Nice scrub with a pleasant scent. Easy to use, extremely gentle, and I was using on one side only so I can see a difference after about 3 or 4 uses. Feels good, works well and no bad after effects, what more do you need?\n",
      "Product: Face Lift Tapes for Instant Face, Neck and Eye Lift Kit Tape\n",
      "Review: There are a number of this type of product on the market and this one does not compare favorably to any others that I’ve tried. They don’t hold well and I didn’t notice any improvement. I’ll keep shopping.\n",
      "Product: Charyeah Bath Pillow Bathtub Spa Pillow With Powerful Gripping Suctions, Comfortable and Soft 2-Panel Cushions for Head, Neck, Back and Shoulder Support,Fits Hot Tub, Jacuzzi, Spas\n",
      "Review: I had a bit of trouble in the beginning getting this set exactly right for me but once it was set up (and I marked the spots the suction cups go onto) it's been a wonder. No more sore neck while soaking. I was worried about it staying damp but it doesn't. I do remove it when I'm not relaxing but it fits very nicely in my linen closet so it's only a second away.\n",
      "Product: Aloe Vera Gel 100% Natural Moisturisers - Pure Organic Fresh Soothing Aloe-Vera Moisturizing Gel Skin Hair, Aloe Leaf Wash-free Clean After Sun Face Body (8.8 oz)\n",
      "Review: This is a great Aloe Gel. I keep in the fridge and use it regularly. It’s light enough weight that it doesn’t feel goopy and washes off clean. Very thick, nice and cold from the fridge and it’s great for too much sun or too much kitchen (burns, cuts, grease spatters, etc.). Easy to use - no nasty smell and works.\n",
      "Product: Nail Files 16 Pcs, Double Sided Emery Board Manicure Tools for Filing Natural Gel and Acrylic Nails for Home and Salon Use\n",
      "Review: These work okay on natural nails but they don't seem to last as long as some of my older ones that are still in use years later. I generally only use them to touch up rough edges or file down broken nails but I couldn't swear to their durability. I can't imagine them working well on acrylics or gels but since I'm not using either right now I can only attest to the fact that they are working on my natural nails and seem to work okay I'm just not sure about their durability.\n",
      "Product: WIS Hyaluronic Acid Facial Masks for Women Anti Aging, Moisturizing for All Skin Type 24 Pcs Sheet Mask, Daily Skin Care\n",
      "Review: I really liked using these. They seemed to have a really good effect, without irritating my very sensitive skin. I'm always worried when I try something new -- I get redness, irritation and in bad cases hives so trying anything is a risk. I had absolutely NO problems with these and they left my skin feeling soft and supple and well moisturized.\n",

      "Review: It says it is for fingernails and toenails. The clipper comes with a catch all for the clippings. It also comes with a faux leather snap shut case that also houses a nail file.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE CLIPPER PERFORM?<br />These clippers are surprinsingly nice.

      "Review: I am all about natural skin care. It is creamy but not heavy. There is a very faint lemon smell, but there is also a smell which is not good- almost like the oils in the cream are about to turn completely rancid. The manufacture date on my box is April 2019. There was no burning or stinging, so it is still okay to use for now. The product is quite nice. The product manufacture date on it is April of 2019. Just make sure to use it up and if you live in a hot climate, keep it in the refrigerator or air conditioning.\n",

      "Review: Let's see what happened.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This has a wood handle for nails or even watercolor painting- it is a nice solid wood handle. The brush itself is a teardrop shape with a very fine point. The ferrule is average, nothing WOW, but not awful either.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />This brush has a nice pocket in it which absorbs the watercolor when using it. I like nail brushes out of synthetic brushes instead of real sable.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.\n",

      "Product: TULA Probiotic Skin Care Supersize 24-7 Moisture Hydrating Day & Night Cream | Holiday 2020, Ageless is the New Anti-Aging, Face Cream, Contains Watermelon Fruit and Blueberry Extract | 3.4 oz\n",
      "Review: This moisturizer, Tula Probiotic Skin Care, is the right consistency for day and/or night. It was nice applying the product and your face feels dewy moist. This is much more preferable than feeling dry, oily or sticky. The scent is strongest when you open and apply. Then it softens and you can barely smell the scent. The ingredients list the scent as parfum/perfume, so you don't know exactly what it is.\n",
      "Product: OGANA CELL Peptide Concentrating Amazing Lotion 2.03 fl.oz. (60ml) - 650ppm Peptide Contained Mild Moisturizing Facial Lotion, Hypoallergenic Natural Ingredients for Sensitive Skin\n",
      "Review: I am impressed. If you have sensitive skin, this is a great product for you. I have dry skin that also has eczema and sometimes rosacea. This does not aggravate either of the conditions and I really like that it is a barrier cream. That helps my skin retain moisture.\n",
      "Product: BABOR Power Serum Ampoules - Hyaluronic Acid | Moisturizing Smoothing and Plumping | 8D Hyaluronic Acid and Tripeptide Intensely Hydrate All Skin's Layers | 7 Days to Hydrated Skin\n",
      "Review: and this is a seven day ampoule set that will give you those results at the end of seven days. In addition to four different advanced Hyaluronic Acids (low, medium and high) + Booster Tripeptides that work together, you will see results. I follow mine with the Doctor Babor Glow Cream, which I really like.\n",
      "Product: CELIMAX The Real Sedum Aqua Boosting Essence - with 65.33% Sedum Extract, Hyaluronic Acid Complex, 150ml\n",
      "Review: I use so many products that give me moisture. I think I am addicted to them. What I know, is that from using this Celimax product and another one that I use, my face keeps moisture in it and that helps keep wrinkles from showing (which is where the hyaluronic acid comes in)\n",
      "Product: ZOUSZ Black Oud Vegan Beard Balm - Classic Wood-Scented Facial Hair Grooming and Skin Care Butter for Men - Avocado, Argan, Macadamia Oils - Vegan Moisturiser, Conditioner, and Dandruff Remover\n",
      "Review: I have been known to use them on my skin and on my hair. I am a woman, but I love this scent. I burn incense with a similar scent. For my hair, I let the balm sit in my palm until it melts it enough to be liquid. Then I put it on the ends of my hair and work it up to about my ears, because the top of my hair is never getting tangled like the rest.\n",
      "Product: HASK CUCUMBER + ALOE Body Wash 2 Pack- Refreshing, vegan formula, hypoallergenic, dermatologist tested, pH balanced- 2 Pack of 24.5 oz Bottles\n",
      "Review: Cucumber and aloe gives you such a refreshing smell. That smell can also make you feel better, The body wash is easy to use and after you lather up, you rinse. It leaves your skin moisturized.\n",
      "Product: NIRA Skincare Laser & Serum Bundle - Includes Anti-Aging Laser & Hyaluronic Acid Serum - Reduces Appearance of Fine Lines & Wrinkles - FDA Cleared\n",
      "Review: Starting the treatment today also. I will use it and hopefully see results. This tool kind of resurfaces your skin and the heat helps to produce collagen. I will give it time and if it doesn't do anything, I will update\n",
      "Product: AAVRANI Travel Discovery Skin Care Set with Exfoliating Cleanser & Facial Mask, Toning Serum, Softening Day & Night Moisturizer & Eye Cream Treatment, Facial Kit for Glowing Skin & Healthy Complexion\n",
      "Review: This travel set has an activating exfoliating cleanser and mask, a bottle of toning goodness, eye serum and a whipped moisturizer. This is what I am taking on vacation with me. I do not like packing up a lot of products that are full sized. This is great for me and my skin.\n",
      "Product: Burt's Bees Baby Bath Time Kit with Ultra Gentle Lotion, Bubble Bath, Foaming Shampoo & Wash, Nourishing Baby Oil, and Face & Hand Cloths\n",
      "Review: Burt's Bees is great for babies, children and adults. It is a nice kit and it is filled with:  Ultra gentle lotion, bubble bath, foaming shampoo and wash, nourishing baby oil, and face and Hand cloths. This can be used on anyone.\n",
      "Product: 2 Pack Foundation Full Coverage Liquid Foundation, Foundation Primer, 4 Makeup Sponge, Cosmetic Bag, 24HR Matte Oil Control Concealer Foundation (Nude #102+Buff Beige #104)\n",
      "Review: Unfortunately, you just can judge how a shade will look on your skin until you can see the foundation against your skin. That is the reason I have been having to get more than just two shades at a time. This product comes with two different shades, but they are for people lighter than me and I am pretty pale.\n",

      "Product: Embryolisse Eau de Beaute Rosamelis Face Toner, 6.76 Fl Oz\n",
      "Review: I love that the toner is in a spray bottle. I wish the instructions were in A bit more clear. I do not know if you are supposed to spray it on your face and go or use a cotton pad. I do not feel a tightening on my skin like most toners. It leaves my skin soft and it smells wonderful! I have just been spraying it on my face after washing and I like that it’s easier, quicker and less waste when you don’t need a cotton pad.\n",
      "Product: JDO Eyelash Curler and 4D Silk Fiber Lash Mascara Value Set-Lash Curler with Refill Pads for No Pinching or Pulling, Mascara Natural Thickening- Long Lasting Waterproof & Smudge-Proof\n",
      "Review: I was not impressed with this when I first received it. The package looked old and faded. However when I opened it and used the eyelash curler I was very impressed. The curler worked quickly and easily , it was comfortable and easy to use- my lashes curled well with one squeeze. It comes with two extra pads for the curler. The mascara wand is small and is able to get every lash. I was told the mascara makes my lashes look very natural-  of clumpy. The mascara really lengthened my lashes.\n",
      "Product: Face Lift Tapes for Instant Face, Neck and Eye Lift Kit Tape\n",
      "Review: I tried these strips and they did not stick well, they popped off so I REALLY my face and put toner on and they still popped off. Not a big fan of this product.\n",

      "Product: Nail Clipper Set, GIDIBII Luxury 18 in 1 Stainless Steel Nail Clipper Kit, Manicure Pedicure Care Tools with Portable Travel Case\n",
      "Review: This is a complete set for doing manicures or pedicures and even a couple for extra things like maybe for your face. All the tools are strong amd sturdy. The case unfortunately is not as strong. The straps that hold the implements in the case  are weak and thin and one broke right away. Overall a good set they definitely thought of everything to include in the kit.\n",

      "Product: Women Ultra Smooth Razor Womens Razors for Shaving Comfortable handle 5-blade Razor + 2 Refill Blades for a Smooth and safety Shave Reusable Razors for Girls Women\n",
      "Review: First of all the handle is a heavy duty handle with some weight to it . It also has a magnetic feature to change the blades . The magnetic feature makes it super easy to change heads. Unfortunately I didn’t  see any replacement heads to order on Amazon. I really like the aloe strip that surrounds the 5 blades , most of my other razors it’s just on one side. The razor cuts close and is comfortable to use. It also comes with a ceramic base to hold it . It looks great and simple while being stored.\n",

      "Product: PINROSE Perfumes Bold Soul - Eau de Parfum Petals (Fragrance Towelettes) - Vegan, Cruelty-free, and Hypoallergenic Scent with Essential Oils - Notes of Crushed Blackberry, Tuberose, Vanilla, Cinnamon and Patchouli\n",
      "Review: These are perfect for on the go and travel. Don't leak and the pads are nicely saturated. Great to keep in makeup bags or even as a stocking stuffer. I don't use perfume everyday, so these last me a while. Nice way to try out a fragrance before committing to a full sized bottle as well. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Product: Nail Files 16 Pcs, Double Sided Emery Board Manicure Tools for Filing Natural Gel and Acrylic Nails for Home and Salon Use\n",
      "Review: These are very good nail files. They work very well, and lasts through multiple uses. I have natural nails, and I I find that the two different grits work well with smoothing edges and removing sharp corners of nails after trimming. I was replacing my old files after every use and the sand was flaking off and getting all over my floors. I did not have any problems with these doing that. Overall, it's a very high quality product and I would highly recommend it, especially for professional use.\n",
      "Product: CONBOLA Make Up Organizer 5 in 1 Dresser Organizer,Portable for Lipstick and Jewlry ,Makeup Organizer and Temporary Makeup Brush Holder,Multi-purpose for Girl Women.36.6cm18cm.(Blue)\n",
      "Review: This is great for minimalists or teenagers. Keeps your essentials organized. you can keep makeup brushes and a few cosmetics in it. It also keeps jewelry, hair ties and other small items organized and easy to find. The mirror is removable as well. Very nice size, and can easily be wiped clean when needed. made of a thick plastic, and the holder slots are silicone. The mirror is a glass mirror. Overall, highly recommended.\n",
      "Product: MIZON Cicaluronic Line, Cicaluronic Cleansing Balm, Makeup Remover, Centella Asiatica,Hyaluronic Acid, One Step Cleansing (2.7 fl oz)\n",
      "Review: I have used the Farmacy cleansing balm for 3 years and this is the first time I have used another brand. I find this balm very hydrating. It removes waterproof makeup very well, has a very fresh scent and with a bit of water turns into a milky cleanser. It also comes with a scoop for sanitary use. Overall, it is a great cleansing balm at a reasonable price. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Product: Huxley Secret of Sahara Clay Mask Balanced Blend 4.23 fl. oz. | Korean Clay Mask to Refine Pores and Absorb Excess Oil and Sebum | Made with Moroccan Rhassoul Clay\n",
      "Review: I have very sensitive dry skin, So I was worried that this would over dry and irritate my skin. First of all, it smells amazing. It smells very natural, like greenery and botanicals. This mask has ever so slightly some grit to it. It isn't the scrubbiest of exfoliating masks. The clay doesn't over dry your skin. I do not feel like my skin is tight feeling after washing my face. Overall, it feels very luxurious and relaxing. Great weekly skin treat to unwind at home. Highly recommended.\n",
