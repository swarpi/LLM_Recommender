3. **Hybrid Recommendation**: Given their tendency towards [theme_2], suggest hybrid products combining elements of different areas.
Example: If they enjoy [hobby1] & [hobby2], propose projects merging skills learned through one hobby with those acquired via another; e.g., "Cycling + Photography" workshops or events blending cycling routes with photography opportunities.
4. **Niche Exploration**: Expand their horizons by recommending niche topics connected to their established passions.
Example: For users passionate about [sports_team], introduce content focused on less mainstream teams, lesser-known players, obscure sports facts, or offbeat rivalries.
5. **Curated Bundle**: Assemble a bundle featuring diverse yet interconnected elements inspired by their varied interests.
Example: Package together items like [item1] + [item2] + [item3]; each item builds upon previous ones, offering a rich experience incorporating multiple facets of the user's profile.
