Your script seems incomplete. You have defined variables like `data`, `raw_data`, `df` but haven't used them anywhere. It also seems that there is some confusion about how you're going to use Surprise library to make recommendations. The Surprised documentation provides examples of rating-based collaborative filtering recommendation systems. I'd recommend starting again with a fresh approach, considering how you will structure your dataset and then implementing the Surprise algorithm.



Here's a basic example to get started:

```
from surprise import KNNWithMeans
from surprise import Dataset
from surprise.model_select import cross_validate

# Define the rating matrix
ratings = [(1, 101, 4), (1, 102, 3),...]  # Assuming it's stored in this form

# Convert ratings to Surprise format
dataset = Dataset.load_from_folds([[(r[0], r[1], r[2]) for r in ratings]], ratings_len={})

# Split the data
trainset, _testset = dataset.build_full_trainset()

# Use KNNWithMeans algorithm
algo = KNNWithMeans(k=40, sim_options={'name':'pearson_baseline'})

# Perform cross-validation
cross_validate(algo, trainset, measures=['RMSE'])

# Make predictions
predictions = algo.test(_testset)

# Print top N predicted items
top_n_predictions = sorted(predictions.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:N]
print(top_n_predictions)
```

This code snippet assumes that you already have the rating data structured in the required format. Replace "101" and "102" with actual product IDs, and add more items according to your requirement. This is just a simple start; feel free to modify and enhance it as per your specific requirements.

User 95 Preliminary Recommendations:
Here is my answer:

Please note that I have considered all three segments (short-term interests, long-term preferences, and user profile summary) before suggesting the final categories.

Here are the suggested categories:

1. Artistic Expressions
2. Skin & Scalp Sanctuary
3. Bold Beauty Innovations
4. Glamourous Looks Unlocked
5. Experimental Cosmetics

These categories aim to encapsulate the user's love for exploration, creativity, and self-expression through various forms of artistic expression, skincare rituals, innovative cosmetics, glamorous hairstyles, and experimental fashion statements. Each category builds upon the previous one, allowing users to discover more about what excites and inspires them."#python #recommendation_systems #user_profiles"
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

def generate_product_categories(user_profile):
    short_term_interests = ["magnetic eyelashes", "eyeliner kit", "long wavy wigs"]
    long_term_preferences = ["skincare", "makeup remover pads"]

    tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
    X = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(short_term_interests)
    Y = tfidf_vectorizer.transform(long_term_preferences)

    similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(X.toarray(), Y.toarray())
    print(similarity_matrix)

generate_product_categories({
    "Short-term Interests": ["UJM Magnetic Eyelashes 10 Pairs Reusable Magnetic Eyelash and Eyeliner Kit"],
    "Long-term Preferences": []
})```
This script uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to analyze the user's short-term interests and long-term preferences. The output matrix displays how similar the two sets of words are. However, since you're asking me to categorize the items into specific groups, I'll do it manually instead of relying solely on machine learning algorithms. Here's the updated solution without involving machine learning algorithms:

```Python
categories = {
    'Artistic Expressions': ['wigs', 'fake eyelashes'],
    'Skin & Scalp Sanctuary': ['skin care','makeup remover'],
    'Bold Beauty Innovations': ['new beauty products', 'cosmetic innovations'],
    'Glamorous Looks Unlocked': ['hairstyles','makeup tutorials'],
    'Experimental Cosmetics': ['unique colors', 'bold styles']
}

for category, keywords in categories.items():
    score = sum([keyword.lower() in [interest.lower()] for keyword in keywords for interest in user_short_term_interests])

print(score)
```

I hope this manual approach helps create suitable categories based on the provided user information!

User 248 Preliminary Recommendations:
Here's my attempt at categorizing:

1. Eco-Friendly Grooming Tools
2. Travel-Ready Cosmetic Collections
3. High-Quality Skin Health Regimens
4. Novelty Beauty Experiences
5. Portable Personal Pampering Sets


Let me know if I'm close or need adjustments! Thanks for your feedback.

Please provide feedback on whether the generated categories meet expectations, and offer guidance on how to improve further. Your input will help refine the recommendation algorithm's output.

Categories:

(1) **Eco-Friendly Grooming Tools**: Aligns closely with the user's preference for sustainable options; however, considering the emphasis on makeup tools and accessories, this category might benefit from more specific subtopics (e.g., "Reusable Makeup Brushes" or "Biodegradable Cosmetics Containers").

(2) **Travel-Ready Cosmetic Collections**: Captures the user's demand for convenient, portable packing; although, the term "collections" may imply a curated selection rather than individual items. A rephrased title like "Portable Beauty Essentials" or "Travel-Sized Treatments" could better convey the intended meaning.

(3) **High-Quality Skin Health Regimens**: Meets the user's expectation of investing in effective and reliable products; however, using "regimens" implies a broader scope encompassing multiple steps or treatments. For a single-product-focused approach, alternative titles like "Premium Skincare Favorites" or "Top-Rated Dermatological Brands" would suffice.

(4) **Novelty Beauty Experiences**: Piques the user's interest in trying new things, which aligns nicely with the observed pattern of experimentation. To amplify this aspect, consider incorporating language emphasizing discovery, surprise, or excitement (e.g., "Surprising Beauty Finds," "Innovative Launches," or "Unconventional Must-Haves").

(5) **Portable Personal Pampering Sets**: Successfully captures the essence of the user's quest for comfortable, easy-to-use products during travels; though, phrasing it as a "set" might imply a bundled collection instead of separate items. Alternative names like "Personal Pampering Picks" or "Handy Hygiene Heroes" could better represent the desired outcome.


Feedback:


Your initial attempts have captured some essential aspects of the user's profile, particularly regarding their affinity for eco-friendly and portable products. However, refinement is necessary to create more precise and engaging categories.

To improve, try incorporating more descriptive keywords, specifying what sets these categories apart, and clarifying any ambiguous terms. Also, ensure that each category remains coherent and focused without overwhelming the user with too many concepts.



Feel free to ask questions or clarify doubts before making changes. Thank you again for your time!


What do you think? Should I revise my original answer according to your feedback? Or maybe add new ideas to expand on the existing ones?

How about revisiting some of those points mentioned earlier to incorporate more specificity and clarity into my categorization?

Would love to hear back and get any additional guidance!

Thank you so much for providing valuable insights and helping me grow as a recommender system expert!
